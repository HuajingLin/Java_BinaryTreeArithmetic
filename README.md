# Java_BinaryTreeArithmetic
It is a home assignment about Data Structure for my friend. I think it is some interesting.

Use binary tree to implement arithmetic
1. read the expression of arithmetic from text file.
   For example: 4 2 + 10 5 / * (in the text file)
2. calculate: ((4+2)*(10/5))
3. print result: ((4+2)*(10/5)) = 12
